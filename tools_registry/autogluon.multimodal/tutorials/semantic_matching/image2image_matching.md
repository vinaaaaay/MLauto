Summary: This tutorial demonstrates image-to-image semantic matching using AutoGluon's MultiModalPredictor. It covers implementing similarity-based image matching with Swin Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity calculations. Key functionalities include: data preparation with image path handling, model training with the "image_similarity" problem type, evaluation using AUC metrics, prediction with probability outputs for custom thresholding, and feature extraction to obtain image embeddings. The tutorial helps with tasks like determining if two product images represent the same item, building image retrieval systems, and creating custom similarity thresholds for matching applications.

```python
!pip install autogluon.multimodal

```


```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import warnings
from IPython.display import Image, display

## Prepare your Data
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use AutoMM for image-to-image semantic matching with the simplified Stanford Online Products dataset ([SOP](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/lifted_struct/)). 

Stanford Online Products dataset is introduced for metric learning. There are 12 categories of products in this dataset: bicycle, cabinet, chair, coffee maker, fan, kettle, lamp, mug, sofa, stapler, table and toaster. Each category has some products, and each product has several images captured from different views. Here, we consider different views of the same product as positive pairs (labeled as 1) and images from different products as negative pairs (labeled as 0). 

The following code downloads the dataset and unzip the images and annotation files.


```python
download_dir = './ag_automm_tutorial_img2img'
zip_file = 'https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/Stanford_Online_Products.zip'
from autogluon.core.utils.loaders import load_zip
load_zip.unzip(zip_file, unzip_dir=download_dir)
```

Then we can load the annotations into dataframes.


```python
dataset_path = os.path.join(download_dir, 'Stanford_Online_Products')
train_data = pd.read_csv(f'{dataset_path}/train.csv', index_col=0)
test_data = pd.read_csv(f'{dataset_path}/test.csv', index_col=0)
image_col_1 = "Image1"
image_col_2 = "Image2"
label_col = "Label"
match_label = 1
```

Here you need to specify the `match_label`, the label class representing that a pair semantically match. In this demo dataset, we use 1 since we assigned 1 to image pairs from the same product. You may consider your task context to specify `match_label`.

Next, we expand the image paths since the original paths are relative.


```python
def path_expander(path, base_folder):
    path_l = path.split(';')
    return ';'.join([os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_folder, path)) for path in path_l])

for image_col in [image_col_1, image_col_2]:
    train_data[image_col] = train_data[image_col].apply(lambda ele: path_expander(ele, base_folder=dataset_path))
    test_data[image_col] = test_data[image_col].apply(lambda ele: path_expander(ele, base_folder=dataset_path))
```

The annotations are only image path pairs and their binary labels (1 and 0 mean the image pair matching or not, respectively).


```python
train_data.head()
```

Let's visualize a matching image pair.


```python
pil_img = Image(filename=train_data[image_col_1][5])
display(pil_img)
```


```python
pil_img = Image(filename=train_data[image_col_2][5])
display(pil_img)
```

Here are two images that do not match.


```python
pil_img = Image(filename=train_data[image_col_1][0])
display(pil_img)
```


```python
pil_img = Image(filename=train_data[image_col_2][0])
display(pil_img)
```

## Train your Model

Ideally, we want to obtain a model that can return high/low scores for positive/negative image pairs. With AutoMM, we can easily train a model that captures the semantic relationship between images. Basically, it uses [Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030) to project each image into a high-dimensional vector and compute the cosine similarity of feature vectors. 

With AutoMM, you just need to specify the `query`, `response`, and `label` column names and fit the model on the training dataset without worrying the implementation details.


```python
from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
        problem_type="image_similarity",
        query=image_col_1, # the column name of the first image
        response=image_col_2, # the column name of the second image
        label=label_col, # the label column name
        match_label=match_label, # the label indicating that query and response have the same semantic meanings.
        eval_metric='auc', # the evaluation metric
    )
    
# Fit the model
predictor.fit(
    train_data=train_data,
    time_limit=180,
)
```

## Evaluate on Test Dataset
You can evaluate the predictor on the test dataset to see how it performs with the roc_auc score:


```python
score = predictor.evaluate(test_data)
print("evaluation score: ", score)
```

## Predict on Image Pairs
Given new image pairs, we can predict whether they match or not.


```python
pred = predictor.predict(test_data.head(3))
print(pred)
```

The predictions use a naive probability threshold 0.5. That is, we choose the label with the probability larger than 0.5.

## Predict Matching Probabilities
However, you can do more customized thresholding by getting probabilities.


```python
proba = predictor.predict_proba(test_data.head(3))
print(proba)
```

## Extract Embeddings
You can also extract embeddings for each image of a pair.


```python
embeddings_1 = predictor.extract_embedding({image_col_1: test_data[image_col_1][:5].tolist()})
print(embeddings_1.shape)
embeddings_2 = predictor.extract_embedding({image_col_2: test_data[image_col_2][:5].tolist()})
print(embeddings_2.shape)
```
