Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing the NHITS neural forecasting model in AutoGluon's time series framework. It covers creating a custom model class that handles preprocessing (filling missing values), configuring hyperparameters (with GPU support), converting data formats, and generating predictions with quantile levels. The implementation supports real-valued covariates (past, known, and static) while handling limitations like NaN values. The tutorial shows how to use the model both standalone and integrated with TimeSeriesPredictor for comparison against other models, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis. This knowledge helps with implementing custom neural forecasting models in AutoGluon's ecosystem.

```python
# We use uv for faster installation
!pip install uv
!uv pip install -q autogluon.timeseries --system
!uv pip uninstall -q torchaudio torchvision torchtext --system # fix incompatible package versions on Colab
```

First, we install the NeuralForecast library that contains the implementation of the custom model used in this tutorial.


```python
pip install -q neuralforecast==2.0
```

## Implement the custom model


To implement a custom model we need to create a subclass of the [`AbstractTimeSeriesModel`](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/blob/master/timeseries/src/autogluon/timeseries/models/abstract/abstract_timeseries_model.py) class. This subclass must implement two methods: `_fit` and `_predict`. For models that require a custom preprocessing logic (e.g., to handle missing values), we also need to implement the `preprocess` method.

Please have a look at the following code and read the comments to understand the different components of the custom model wrapper.

```

For convenience, here is an overview of the main constraints on the inputs and outputs of different methods.

- Input data received by `_fit` and `_predict` methods satisfies
    - the index is sorted by `(item_id, timestamp)`
    - timestamps of observations have a regular frequency corresponding to `self.freq`
    - column `self.target` contains the target values of the time series
    - target column might contain missing values represented by `NaN`
    - data may contain covariates (incl. static features) with schema described in `self.covariate_metadata`
        - real-valued covariates have dtype `float32`
        - categorical covariates have dtype `category`
        - covariates do not contain any missing values
    - static features, if present, are available as `data.static_features`
- Predictions returned by `_predict` must satisfy:
    - returns predictions as a `TimeSeriesDataFrame` object
    - predictions contain columns `["mean"] + [str(q) for q in self.quantile_levels]` containing the point and quantile forecasts, respectively
    - the index of predictions contains exactly `self.prediction_length` future time steps of each time series present in `data`
    - the frequency of the prediction timestamps matches `self.freq`
    - the index of predictions is sorted by `(item_id, timestamp)`
    - predictions contain no missing values represented by `NaN` and no gaps
- The runtime of `_fit` method should not exceed `time_limit` seconds, if `time_limit` is provided.
- None of the methods should modify the data in-place. If modifications are needed, create a copy of the data first.
- All methods should work even if some time series consist of all NaNs, or only have a single observation.

-----

We will now use this wrapper in two modes:
1. Standalone mode (outside the `TimeSeriesPredictor`).
    - This mode should be used for development and debugging. In this case, we need to take manually take care of preprocessing and model configuration.
2. Inside the `TimeSeriesPredictor`.
    - This mode makes it easy to combine & compare the custom model with other models available in AutoGluon. The main purpose of writing a custom model wrapper is to use it in this mode.

## Load and preprocess the data

First, we load the Grocery Sales dataset that we will use for development and evaluation.


```python
from autogluon.timeseries import TimeSeriesDataFrame

raw_data = TimeSeriesDataFrame.from_path(
    "https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/grocery_sales/test.csv",
    static_features_path="https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/grocery_sales/static.csv",
)
raw_data.head()
```


```python
raw_data.static_features.head()
```


```python
print("Types of the columns in raw data:")
print(raw_data.dtypes)
print("\nTypes of the columns in raw static features:")
print(raw_data.static_features.dtypes)

print("\nNumber of missing values per column:")
print(raw_data.isna().sum())
```

Define the forecasting task


```python
prediction_length = 7  # number of future steps to predict
target = "unit_sales"  # target column
known_covariates_names = ["promotion_email", "promotion_homepage"]  # covariates known in the future
```

Before we use the model in standalone mode, we need to apply the general AutoGluon preprocessing to the data.

The `TimeSeriesFeatureGenerator` captures preprocessing steps like normalizing the data types and imputing the missing values in the covariates.


```python
from autogluon.timeseries.utils.features import TimeSeriesFeatureGenerator

feature_generator = TimeSeriesFeatureGenerator(target=target, known_covariates_names=known_covariates_names)
data = feature_generator.fit_transform(raw_data)
```


```python
print("Types of the columns in preprocessed data:")
print(data.dtypes)
print("\nTypes of the columns in preprocessed static features:")
print(data.static_features.dtypes)

print("\nNumber of missing values per column:")
print(data.isna().sum())
```

## Using the custom model in standalone mode
Using the model in standalone mode is useful for debugging our implementation. Once we make sure that all methods work as expected, we will use the model inside the `TimeSeriesPredictor`.

### Training
We are now ready to train the custom model on the preprocessed data.

When using the model in standalone mode, we need to manually configure its parameters.


```python
model = NHITSModel(
    prediction_length=prediction_length,
    target=target,
    covariate_metadata=feature_generator.covariate_metadata,
    freq=data.freq,
    quantile_levels=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9],
)
model.fit(train_data=data, time_limit=20)
```

### Predicting and scoring


```python
past_data, known_covariates = data.get_model_inputs_for_scoring(
    prediction_length=prediction_length,
    known_covariates_names=known_covariates_names,
)
predictions = model.predict(past_data, known_covariates)
predictions.head()
```


```python
model.score(data)
```

## Using the custom model inside the `TimeSeriesPredictor`
After we made sure that our custom model works in standalone mode, we can pass it to the TimeSeriesPredictor alongside other models.


```python
from autogluon.timeseries import TimeSeriesPredictor

train_data, test_data = raw_data.train_test_split(prediction_length)

predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(
    prediction_length=prediction_length,
    target=target,
    known_covariates_names=known_covariates_names,
)

predictor.fit(
    train_data,
    hyperparameters={
        "Naive": {},
        "Chronos": {"model_path": "bolt_small"},
        "ETS": {},
        NHITSModel: {},
    },
    time_limit=120,
)
```

Note that when we use the custom model inside the predictor, we don't need to worry about:
- manually configuring the model (setting `freq`, `prediction_length`)
- preprocessing the data using `TimeSeriesFeatureGenerator`
- setting the time limits

The `TimeSeriesPredictor` automatically takes care of all above aspects.

We can also easily compare our custom model with other model trained by the predictor.


```python
predictor.leaderboard(test_data)
```

We can also take advantage of other predictor functionality such as `feature_importance`.


```python
predictor.feature_importance(test_data, model="NHITS")
```

As expected, features `product_category` and `product_subcategory` have zero importance because our implementation ignores categorical features.

-----

Here is how we can train multiple versions of the custom model with different hyperparameter configurations


```python
predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(
    prediction_length=prediction_length,
    target=target,
    known_covariates_names=known_covariates_names,
)
predictor.fit(
    train_data,
    hyperparameters={
        NHITSModel: [
            {},  # default hyperparameters
            {"input_size": 20},  # custom input_size
            {"scaler_type": "robust"},  # custom scaler_type
        ]
    },
    time_limit=60,
)
```


```python
predictor.leaderboard(test_data)
```

## Wrapping up

That's all it takes to add a custom forecasting model to AutoGluon. If you create a custom model, consider [submitting a PR](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pulls) so that we can add it officially to AutoGluon!
