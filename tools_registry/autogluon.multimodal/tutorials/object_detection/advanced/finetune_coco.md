Summary: This tutorial demonstrates object detection using AutoGluon MultiModal, focusing on fine-tuning YOLOX models on custom datasets in COCO format. It covers installation of required packages, dataset preparation, model configuration with two-stage learning rates, training with early stopping, evaluation using mAP metrics, and result visualization. Key functionalities include configuring GPU usage, batch size optimization, using quality presets for simplified workflows, and performance tuning options. The tutorial helps with implementing custom object detection systems, visualizing detection results, and optimizing model performance through hyperparameter adjustments.

```python
!pip install autogluon.multimodal
```


```python
# Update package tools and install build dependencies
!pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
!sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build gcc g++

# Install MMCV
!python3 -m mim install "mmcv==2.1.0"

# For Google Colab users: If the above fails, use this alternative MMCV installation
# pip install "mmcv==2.1.0" -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu121/torch2.1.0/index.html

# Install MMDet
!python3 -m pip install "mmdet==3.2.0"

# Install MMEngine (version >=0.10.6 for PyTorch 2.5 compatibility)
!python3 -m pip install "mmengine>=0.10.6"
```


```python
from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
```

And also import some other packages that will be used in this tutorial:


```python
import os

from autogluon.core.utils.loaders import load_zip
```

We have the sample dataset ready in the cloud. Let's download it and store the paths for each data split:


```python
zip_file = "https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/object_detection/dataset/pothole.zip"
download_dir = "./pothole"

load_zip.unzip(zip_file, unzip_dir=download_dir)
data_dir = os.path.join(download_dir, "pothole")
train_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "Annotations", "usersplit_train_cocoformat.json")
val_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "Annotations", "usersplit_val_cocoformat.json")
test_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "Annotations", "usersplit_test_cocoformat.json")
```

While using COCO format dataset, the input is the json annotation file of the dataset split.
In this example, `usersplit_train_cocoformat.json` is the annotation file of the train split.
`usersplit_val_cocoformat.json` is the annotation file of the validation split.
And `usersplit_test_cocoformat.json` is the annotation file of the test split.

We select the YOLOX-small model pretrained on COCO dataset. With this setting, it is fast to finetune or inference,
and easy to deploy. Note that you can use a larger model by setting the `checkpoint_name` to corresponding checkpoint name for better performance (but usually with slower speed).
And you may need to change the lr and per_gpu_batch_size for a different model.
An easier way is to use our predefined presets `"medium_quality"`, `"high_quality"`, or `"best_quality"`.
For more about using presets, see [Quick Start Coco](../quick_start/quick_start_coco).



```python
checkpoint_name = "yolox_s"
num_gpus = 1  # only use one GPU
```

We create the MultiModalPredictor with selected checkpoint name and number of GPUs.
We need to specify the problem_type to `"object_detection"`,
and also provide a `sample_data_path` for the predictor to infer the categories of the dataset.
Here we provide the `train_path`, and it also works using any other split of this dataset.


```python
predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
    hyperparameters={
        "model.mmdet_image.checkpoint_name": checkpoint_name,
        "env.num_gpus": num_gpus,
    },
    problem_type="object_detection",
    sample_data_path=train_path,
)
```

We set the learning rate to be `1e-4`.
Note that we use a two-stage learning rate option during finetuning by default,
and the model head will have 100x learning rate.
Using a two-stage learning rate with high learning rate only on head layers makes
the model converge faster during finetuning. It usually gives better performance as well,
especially on small datasets with hundreds or thousands of images.
We set batch size to be 16, and you can increase or decrease the batch size based on your available GPU memory.
We set max number of epochs to 30, number of validation check per interval to 1.0,
and validation check per n epochs to 3 for fast finetuning.
We also compute the time of the fit process here for better understanding the speed.


```python
predictor.fit(
    train_path,
    tuning_data=val_path,
    hyperparameters={
        "optim.lr": 1e-4,  # we use two stage and detection head has 100x lr
        "env.per_gpu_batch_size": 16,  # decrease it when model is large or GPU memory is small
        "optim.max_epochs": 30,  # max number of training epochs, note that we may early stop before this based on validation setting
        "optim.val_check_interval": 1.0,  # Do 1 validation each epoch
        "optim.check_val_every_n_epoch": 3,  # Do 1 validation each 3 epochs
        "optim.patience": 3,  # Early stop after 3 consective validations are not the best
    },
)
```

To evaluate the model we just trained, run:


```python
predictor.evaluate(test_path)
```

Note that it's always recommended to use our predefined presets to save customization time with following code script:

```python
predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
    problem_type="object_detection",
    sample_data_path=train_path,
    presets="medium_quality",
)
predictor.fit(train_path, tuning_data=val_path)
predictor.evaluate(test_path)
```

For more about using presets, see [Quick Start Coco](../quick_start/quick_start_coco).


And the evaluation results are shown in command line output. 
The first value is mAP in COCO standard, and the second one is mAP in VOC standard (or mAP50). 
For more details about these metrics, see [COCO's evaluation guideline](https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval).

We can get the prediction on test set:


```python
pred = predictor.predict(test_path)
```

Let's also visualize the prediction result:


```python
!pip install opencv-python
```


```python
from autogluon.multimodal.utils import visualize_detection
conf_threshold = 0.25  # Specify a confidence threshold to filter out unwanted boxes
visualization_result_dir = "./"  # Use the pwd as result dir to save the visualized image
visualized = visualize_detection(
    pred=pred[12:13],
    detection_classes=predictor.classes,
    conf_threshold=conf_threshold,
    visualization_result_dir=visualization_result_dir,
)
from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import display
img = Image.fromarray(visualized[0][:, :, ::-1], 'RGB')
display(img)
```

Under this fast finetune setting, we reached a good mAP number on a new dataset with a few hundred seconds!
For how to finetune with higher performance,
see [AutoMM Detection - High Performance Finetune on COCO Format Dataset](../finetune/detection_high_performance_finetune_coco.ipynb), where we finetuned a VFNet model with 
5 hours and reached `mAP = 0.450, mAP50 = 0.718` on this dataset.
