Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing object detection with AutoGluon's MultiModalPredictor. It covers installation requirements, dataset preparation, model configuration with three quality presets (YOLOX-large, DINO-Resnet50, DINO-SwinL), training and evaluation workflows, model saving/loading, and inference techniques. Key functionalities include prediction in both CSV and COCO formats, visualization of detection results using OpenCV, and custom inference on new images through either COCO JSON format or direct image path lists. The tutorial provides practical code for implementing complete object detection pipelines with performance optimization options.

To start, make sure `mmcv` and `mmdet` are installed.
**Note:** MMDet is no longer actively maintained and is only compatible with MMCV version 2.1.0. Installation can be problematic due to CUDA version compatibility issues. For best results:
1. Use CUDA 12.4 with PyTorch 2.5
2. Before installation, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
   sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build gcc g++
   ```
   This will help prevent MMCV installation from hanging during wheel building.
3. After installation in Jupyter notebook, restart the kernel for changes to take effect.



```python
!pip install autogluon.multimodal
```


```python
# Update package tools and install build dependencies
!pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
!sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build gcc g++

# Install MMCV
!python3 -m mim install "mmcv==2.1.0"

# For Google Colab users: If the above fails, use this alternative MMCV installation
# pip install "mmcv==2.1.0" -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu121/torch2.1.0/index.html

# Install MMDet
!python3 -m pip install "mmdet==3.2.0"

# Install MMEngine (version >=0.10.6 for PyTorch 2.5 compatibility)
!python3 -m pip install "mmengine>=0.10.6"
```

To start, let's import MultiModalPredictor:


```python
from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
```

And also import some other packages that will be used in this tutorial:


```python
import os
import time

from autogluon.core.utils.loaders import load_zip
```

## Downloading Data
We have the sample dataset ready in the cloud. Let's download it:


```python
zip_file = "https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/object_detection_dataset/tiny_motorbike_coco.zip"
download_dir = "./tiny_motorbike_coco"

load_zip.unzip(zip_file, unzip_dir=download_dir)
data_dir = os.path.join(download_dir, "tiny_motorbike")
train_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "Annotations", "trainval_cocoformat.json")
test_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "Annotations", "test_cocoformat.json")
```

### Dataset Format

For COCO format datasets, provide JSON annotation files for each split:

- `trainval_cocoformat.json`: train and validation data
- `test_cocoformat.json`: test data

### Model Selection

We use the `medium_quality` preset which features:

- Base model: YOLOX-large (pretrained on COCO)
- Benefits: Fast finetuning, quick inference, easy deployment

Alternative presets available:

- `high_quality`: DINO-Resnet50 model
- `best_quality`: DINO-SwinL model

Both alternatives offer improved performance at the cost of slower processing and higher GPU memory requirements.


```python
presets = "medium_quality"
```

When creating the MultiModalPredictor, specify these essential parameters:

- `problem_type="object_detection"` to define the task
- `presets="medium_quality"` for presets selection
- `sample_data_path` pointing to any dataset split (typically train_path) to infer object categories
- `path` (optional) to set a custom save location

If no path is specified, the model will be automatically saved to a timestamped directory under AutogluonModels/.


```python
# Init predictor
import uuid

model_path = f"./tmp/{uuid.uuid4().hex}-quick_start_tutorial_temp_save"

predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
    problem_type="object_detection",
    sample_data_path=train_path,
    presets=presets,
    path=model_path,
)
```

## Finetuning the Model
The model uses optimized preset configurations for learning rate, epochs, and batch size. By default, it employs a two-stage learning rate strategy:

Model head layers use 100x higher learning rate
This approach accelerates convergence and typically improves performance, especially for small datasets (hundreds to thousands of images)

Timing results below are from a test run on AWS g4.2xlarge EC2 instance:


```python
start = time.time()
predictor.fit(train_path)  # Fit
train_end = time.time()
```

Notice that at the end of each progress bar, if the checkpoint at current stage is saved,
it prints the model's save path.
In this example, it's `./quick_start_tutorial_temp_save`.

Print out the time and we can see that it's fast!


```python
print("This finetuning takes %.2f seconds." % (train_end - start))
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model we just trained, run following code.

And the evaluation results are shown in command line output. 
The first line is mAP in COCO standard, and the second line is mAP in VOC standard (or mAP50). 
For more details about these metrics, see [COCO's evaluation guideline](https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval).
Note that for presenting a fast finetuning we use presets "medium_quality", 
you could get better result on this dataset by simply using "high_quality" or "best_quality" presets, 
or customize your own model and hyperparameter settings: [Customization](../../advanced_topics/customization.ipynb), and some other examples at [Fast Fine-tune Coco](../finetune/detection_fast_finetune_coco) or [High Performance Fine-tune Coco](../finetune/detection_high_performance_finetune_coco).


```python
predictor.evaluate(test_path)
eval_end = time.time()
```

Print out the evaluation time:


```python
print("The evaluation takes %.2f seconds." % (eval_end - train_end))
```

We can load a new predictor with previous save path,
and we can also reset the number of used GPUs if not all the devices are available:


```python
# Load and reset num_gpus
new_predictor = MultiModalPredictor.load(model_path)
new_predictor.set_num_gpus(1)
```

Evaluating the new predictor gives us exactly the same result:


```python
# Evaluate new predictor
new_predictor.evaluate(test_path)
```

For how to set the hyperparameters and finetune the model with higher performance, 
see [AutoMM Detection - High Performance Finetune on COCO Format Dataset](../finetune/detection_high_performance_finetune_coco.ipynb).

## Inference
Let's perform predictions using our finetuned model. The predictor can process the entire test set with a single command:


```python
pred = predictor.predict(test_path)
print(len(pred))  # Number of predictions
print(pred[:3])   # Sample of first 3 predictions
```

The predictor returns predictions as a pandas DataFrame with two columns:
- `image`: Contains path to each input image
- `bboxes`: Contains list of detected objects, where each object is a dictionary:
  ```python
  {
      "class": "predicted_class_name",
      "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],  # Coordinates of Upper Left and Bottom Right corners
      "score": confidence_score
  }
  ```

By default, predictions are returned but not saved. To save detection results, use the save parameter in your predict call.


```python
# To save as csv format
pred = predictor.predict(test_path, save_results=True, as_coco=False)
# Or to save as COCO format. Note that the `pred` returned is always a pandas dataframe.
pred = predictor.predict(test_path, save_results=True, as_coco=True, result_save_path="./results.json")
```

The predictions can be saved in two formats:

- CSV file: Matches the DataFrame structure with image and bboxes columns
- COCO JSON: Standard COCO format annotation file

This works with any predictor configuration (pretrained or finetuned models).

## Visualizing Results
To run visualizations, ensure that you have `opencv` installed. If you haven't already, install `opencv` by running


```python
!pip install opencv-python
```

To visualize the detection bounding boxes, run the following:


```python
from autogluon.multimodal.utils import ObjectDetectionVisualizer

conf_threshold = 0.4  # Specify a confidence threshold to filter out unwanted boxes
image_result = pred.iloc[30]

img_path = image_result.image  # Select an image to visualize

visualizer = ObjectDetectionVisualizer(img_path)  # Initialize the Visualizer
out = visualizer.draw_instance_predictions(image_result, conf_threshold=conf_threshold)  # Draw detections
visualized = out.get_image()  # Get the visualized image

from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import display
img = Image.fromarray(visualized, 'RGB')
display(img)
```

## Testing on Your Own Data
You can also predict on your own images with various input format. The follow is an example:

Download the example image:


```python
from autogluon.multimodal.utils import download
image_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/gluoncv/detection/street_small.jpg"
test_image = download(image_url)
```

Run inference on data in a json file of COCO format (See [Convert Data to COCO Format](../data_preparation/convert_data_to_coco_format.ipynb) for more details about COCO format). Note that since the root is by default the parent folder of the annotation file, here we put the annotation file in a folder:


```python
import json

# create a input file for demo
data = {"images": [{"id": 0, "width": -1, "height": -1, "file_name": test_image}], "categories": []}
os.mkdir("input_data_for_demo")
input_file = "input_data_for_demo/demo_annotation.json"
with open(input_file, "w+") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

pred_test_image = predictor.predict(input_file)
print(pred_test_image)
```

Run inference on data in a list of image file names:


```python
pred_test_image = predictor.predict([test_image])
print(pred_test_image)
```
